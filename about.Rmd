## About Me
Hi, my name is [Tejas Mundhe](https://github.com/TejasMundhe) and I am an incoming freshman at Walnut Hills High School. I enjoy playing soccer and swimming as well as having a passion for computer science where I have coded in Javascript Python, and R.

## About this Project 
This project was made through [Kaneâ€™s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info) to explore how different states were affected by the Covid-19 Pandemic. The data set for this project was from a [Covid 19 Vaccines and Deaths by State Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nanopepe/covid-19-vaccines-and-deaths-by-state) in which the data was gathered directly from the CDC.

## Goals
* To Visualize the Covid-19 Deaths for every U.S state
* Learn about making plots and websites that are available on the internet
* Take my first steps into the world of data science
